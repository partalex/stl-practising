# STL Practicing

## Overview

This repository contains various examples and practice exercises for the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), focusing on **algorithm** and **numeric** libraries up to the latest standard, **C++23**. The aim is to provide hands-on examples to help developers understand and utilize the powerful tools offered by the STL.

### Libraries Covered

- **Algorithm Library**: A collection of examples demonstrating sorting, searching, modifying sequences, and more.
- **Numeric Library**: Examples focusing on numeric operations like accumulation, inner product, and other mathematical utilities.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure your compiler supports **C++23** features.
- **Build System**: Examples can be compiled using `g++` or `clang++`. You may also use CMake for easier project setup and compilation.
